## Software Platform for Mental Patients Management in Social Institutions at HFF

Hospital Fernando Fonseca is an organization that manages patients with mental diseases sent to Care Houses that are able to take care of them for 24 hours a day. These patients can be sent to the Care Houses by the hospital itself or by other institutions. Once a patient has entered a Care House, the HFF is responsible for the payment of the daily cares of the patient. In case the patient comes from another institution, then it is the institutionâ€™s responsibility to make these payments.

Once in the Care House, a patient might need to go to other institutions, such as hospitals, for other health related reasons. During these days, the care of the patients should not be billed since they are not in the Care House. This however, poses a problem be- cause the HFF cannot track these visits since they are only managed by the Care House, which can lead to the days being billed without the knowledge of the HFF.

The current process of referring a patient to a Care House and managing their internment is made manually, and the communication between the HFF and the Care Houses is made via e-mail. This makes the process slow and prone to failure.

This project is a partnership between ISEL and HFF to develop a web application that can be accessed by the members of the HFF involved in the referral process and financial management, as well as the members of the Care Houses who manage the interned patients, which allows the different departments that take part in this process to communicate better with each other in order to simplify the process and guarantee the correct billing for the care of the patients.
